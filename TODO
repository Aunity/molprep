* deal properly with C-terminus
* deal properly with (missing) altLocs,
* check top.dat for completeness, in particular end termini of protonated
  residues and the res_type
* rename residues back to standard PDB files if requested
* function to reorder to PDB order
* translation table for atom/residue names (e.g. ILE CD -> CD1, HSD -> HIS)
* protonate waters in a less arbitrary fashion?
* use Better String Library http://bstring.sourceforge.net/ ?
* doxygen or similar?
* read GROMACS v-site paper
* proper unit tests
